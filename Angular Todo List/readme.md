Angular Todo List Project We have provided the basic structure for an Angular component in the starter code. Your task is to create a Todo List application with added functionality. You will need to write the HTML template for the application. The application should consist of a text input field and a button with the text "Submit" within it. When the user enters a task in the input field and clicks the submit button, the task should be added to a list displayed on the screen. Additionally, each task should have a button next to it to remove that specific task from the list. Each task should be displayed as an item in an unordered list on the screen. You are free to add classes and styles, but make sure you leave the component ID's and clases provided as they are. Submit your code once it is complete and our system will validate your output.
